# Journal

This is a small Rails 5 app for creating a Journal. I built this as a quick
alternative to Day One.

## Usage

Run the setup script, edit the `.env` file as required and then run the server

```bash
bin/setup
bin/rails server
```

Then access the app at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Importing data from Day One

Create an export of your Day One journal. You can do this by right clicking the
journal, choosing export and then JSON

Extract the zip file into a directory called `dayone` in the root of this app.

Run the `import.rb` script:

```
rails runner import.rb
```

You should see some output like so:
